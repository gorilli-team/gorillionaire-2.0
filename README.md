## 1. Overview

Gorillionaire is an innovative AI Crypto Signals & Gamified Trading platform. Maximize your profits by accessing to premium trading signal generated by our Signal Agent, which will give you the most up to date suggestions based on actual market conditions. Gain points with every trade you make, enjoy the competition with other traders, and make a living by accessing every market opportunity available to you!

## 2. Target audience

Gorillionaire is a platform that makes trading tokens easier and quicker, allowing both degens and seasoned tradfi traders to access the market's most hidden opportunities. The trading signal system lowers the access barriers to this kind of activities, allowing for mass-adoption of the platform.

## 3. Long-term sustainability

Signals generated by our agent are stored in an encrypted database provided by Nillion. This allows the project to grant access to users willing to contribute by purchasing the Gorillionaire Access NFT, which will allow complete access to the signal generation function, as well as fostering the competition on the trader's leaderboard.

## 9. Implementation

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center">
<img src="./docs/img/Final diagram (minimal).png" alt="Implementation Diagram" width="800" height="650"></img>
</div>

### 9.1 Token tracking

The best trading signals are generated with the most accurate events and information about the tokens available. We decided to track the 3 most traded tokens in the Monad Testnet, which are Molandak (DAK), Moyaki (YAKI), and Chog (CHOG).<br>
We acquire information regarding transfers, spikes, new listings, token holders, tokens price evolution, and the native token MON price. These information are fetched via 4 different services:

- **Envio**: transfers, spikes, listings
- **Codex**: tokens price
- **Blockvision**: token holders
- **Pyth**: MON price

All the data are then stored on MongoDB (except for the MON price which is rendered on the frontend).

More details [here]().

### 9.2 Data polling

The raw data stored on MongoDB are then fetched every 30 minutes by the Signal Agent, which will query each collections and will fetch only the newly added events. Langchain's text splitter has been used for converting those events into machine readable vectors via the OpenAI Embeddings. Those embeddings are then stored in a Supabase database for the next step.

More details [here](./langchain/README.md).

### 9.3 Signal generation

The signal generation process has been created with Langchain. This tool helped us to structure a chain of prompts that translates an input prompt into an actionable and coherent trading signal. Thanks to the `match_documents` function on Supabase database, we are able to find the best events for the input prompt given. These events will then serve as the context for the generated signal.

More details [here](./langchain/README.md).

### 9.4 Nillion's Secret Vault

All the signals are stored in a decentralized database provided by Nillion. Thanks to Nillion, we are able to guarantee the encryption of both the trading signal text and the events that generated it, granting exclusive access only to those users that purchased the Gorillionaire Access NFT.

More details [here](./nillion/README.md).

### 9.5 AccessNFT smart contract

The smart contract for minting the Gorillionare Access NFT has been deployed on the Monad Testnet at the following address:

- [0x12bF70e3325104ed2D7fefbB8f3e88cE2Dd66A30](https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/address/0x12bF70e3325104ed2D7fefbB8f3e88cE2Dd66A30)

AccessNFT is a standard ERC721 contract that allows users to mint their NFT, with a minimum value sent of 1 MON. This NFT will serve as the access key to the exclusive signals generated by the agent.

More details [here](./access-nft/README.md).

## 10. License

The project has been developed for the Monad EVM/ACCATHON. All the files are licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). We reserve the rights to change the license for further production deployment of the entire project.
